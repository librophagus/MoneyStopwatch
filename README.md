# MoneyStopwatch

Simple application made in Java using Swing/AWT and Eclipse's WindowBuilder. It is designed to keep track of how much money one has earned given an hourly wage and an already elapsed time. I made this to quantify the time passed while working a work-at-home job with no other contact during long hours.
